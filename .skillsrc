# Presence in 'skills' list = Active. To disable a skill, remove it from the list.
# 'exclude': IDs of sub-skills to skip during sync (auto-populated with undetected skills).
# 'custom_overrides': IDs of skills to PROTECT. Use this if you have modified a standard 
# skill locally and don't want the CLI to overwrite it.
#
# Run 'ags list-skills' to view all available skills.

## **Rule Zero: Zero-Trust Engineering**

🚨 **IMPORTANT:** Never assume existing code follows the standard. Existing files may contain legacy technical debt or non-compliant patterns (e.g., hardcoded colors).

- **Skill Authority:** Loaded skills always override existing code patterns.
- **Retrieval-First:** Before writing a single line of code, identify and read relevant skill files listed below.
- **Audit Before Write:** Audit every file write against the `common/feedback-reporter` skill.

IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning. Consult skill files before acting.
